# Front-end final assignment

Assignment is based on my final year project carpooling app. Website is a single page site. HTML and CSS all validated with no errors through W3 Validation service along with Javascript ES6 used consistently. Github's API was used to get JSON about number of commits, watchers and forkers. Current 1 breakpoint for screens bigger than the width of 600px as mobile and table responsiveness works fine tested on multiple mobile phones. Local storage has also been utilized for the sign up input field.

## Validation

| Type  | Method | Result |
| ------------- | -------------  |------------- |
| HTML  | W3C validator | No errors  |
| CSS  | W3C validator	 |No errors  |
| JS | Console |No errors  |
